Abstract contract responsible for accruing and distributing rewards to users for providing
liquidity to perpetual markets (handled by PerpRewardDistributor) or staking tokens (with the SafetyModule)

*Inherits from RewardController, which defines the RewardInfo data structure and functions allowing
governance to add/remove reward tokens or update their parameters, and implements IStakingContract, the
interface used by the ClearingHouse to update user rewards any time a user's position is updated*
