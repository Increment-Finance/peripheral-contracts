```

### RewardClaimed
Emitted when a user claims their accrued rewards

## Errors
### RewardDistributor_InvalidMarketIndex
Error returned when an invalid index is passed into `getMarketAddress`


```solidity
error RewardDistributor_InvalidMarketIndex(uint256 index, uint256 maxIndex);
```

### RewardDistributor_UninitializedStartTime
Error returned when calling `viewNewRewardAccrual` with a market that has never accrued rewards

*Occurs when `timeOfLastCumRewardUpdate[market] == 0`. This value is updated whenever
`updateMarketRewards(market)` is called, which is quite often.*


```solidity
error RewardDistributor_UninitializedStartTime(address market);
```

### RewardDistributor_AlreadyInitializedStartTime
Error returned when calling `initMarketStartTime` with a market that already has a non-zero
`timeOfLastCumRewardUpdate`


```solidity
error RewardDistributor_AlreadyInitializedStartTime(address market);
```

### RewardDistributor_PositionAlreadyRegistered
Error returned if a user calls `registerPositions` when the reward distributor has already
stored their position for a market


```solidity
error RewardDistributor_PositionAlreadyRegistered(address user, address market, uint256 position);
```

### RewardDistributor_EarlyRewardAccrual

penalty period is over


```solidity
error RewardDistributor_EarlyRewardAccrual(address user, address market, uint256 claimAllowedTimestamp);
```

### RewardDistributor_UserPositionMismatch
Error returned if a user's position stored in the RewardDistributor does not match their current position in a given market

*Only possible when the user had a pre-existing position in the market before the RewardDistributor
was deployed, and has not called `registerPositions` yet*


```solidity
error RewardDistributor_UserPositionMismatch(
    address user, address market, uint256 storedPosition, uint256 actualPosition
);
```

### RewardDistributor_InvalidEcosystemReserve
Error returned if governance tries to set the ecosystem reserve to the zero address


```solidity
error RewardDistributor_InvalidEcosystemReserve(address invalidAddress);
```
